I am a computer scientist currently interning at the New York CTO office of Bloomberg LP. <br>
On this website, you can find pretty much everything I have worked on in my career.

# Trivia

I was born in Turin, Italy, and have been tinkering with computers for as long as
I can remember. I started working professionally as a developer in 2013. After three years,
I started a bachelor degree in Computer Science, while I kept working part-time as game developer.
Once I graduated, I moved to Germany, and started a Joint Master and Ph.D. program. 
After completing my Masterâ€™s program, publishing my first research paper, and doing an R&D internship in U.S., I decided to suspend my Ph.D. to return in the industry.
