I am a computer scientist currently pursuing a Ph.D. at [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) under the supervision of [Bj√∂rn Brandenburg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/).

# Long story short

I was born in Turin, Italy, and have been tinkering with computers for as long as I can remember. In 2013 --- I was eighteen --- I started working professionally as a programmer. After three years, I decided to start a bachelor degree in Computer Science, while I kept working part-time as game developer. Once I graduated, I moved to Kaiserslautern, Germany, and started a Joint Master and Ph.D program.
I completed my master courses and just published my first research paper.
