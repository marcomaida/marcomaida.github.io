I am a **computer scientist** currently working at [Wayve](http://wayve.ai/), an autonomous driving technology company based in London.

I have a **Master's degree** and over **ten years of professional experience**. <br>
My background is a mixed bag of **Robotics and AI**, **industrial software development**, **videogames development**, and **real-time systems research**.

**On this website**, you can find the most important things I have worked on in my career.

# Trivia

I started working professionally in **2013**, writing software for **industrial** glass cutting **optimisation**. 

In **2016**, I entered the **videogame development** world. In the following years, I split my time between work and student life, obtaining a bachelor's degree (focus on **formal methods**), and contributed to five major game releases at 34BigThings.

Once graduated, I moved to Germany and started a **joint master's and Ph.D. program** at **Max Planck Institute**, working at the intersection of **real-time systems** and **formal verification**. 

By **2022** I had completed my Master's, first-authored a research paper, and completed a research internship at Bloomberg LP. I decided to suspend my Ph.D. and return to the industry. 

Following my matured passion for **robotics** and **AI**, I moved to London and joined **Wayve Ltd**, building autonomous driving technologies.
