I am a computer scientist currently pursuing a Ph.D. at [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) under the supervision of [Bj√∂rn Brandenburg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/).

# Research at MPI-SWS

I work in the field of **real-time systems**, under the [TOROS](https://toros.mpi-sws.org/) grant. 

The long-term goal of the TOROS project is to develop a **real-time operating system** that _by design_ ensures that the temporal behavior of its user-level applications can be analyzed.

I currently work on the **intersection** between **real-time schedulability theory** and **formal verification**. I am a core maintainer of [Prosa](http://prosa.mpi-sws.org/), a machine-checked library written in Coq regarding real-time schedulability analysis. 

# Long story short

I was born in **Turin, Italy**, and have been tinkering with computers for as long as I can remember. In 2013 --- I was eighteen --- I started working professionally as a programmer. After three years, I decided to start a bachelor degree in Computer Science, while I kept working part-time as game developer. Once I graduated, I moved to Kaiserslautern, Germany, and started a Joint Master and **Ph.D program**.
I completed my master courses and just published my first research paper.
